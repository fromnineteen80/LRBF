## Testing Guide

### Test 1: API Endpoint

curl http://localhost:5000/api/market-status

**Expected during market hours:**
- status: "open"
- is_trading_day: true
- progress_pct: 0-100
- time_remaining: "H:MM:SS"

### Test 2: Progress Bar Animation

1. Start Flask app
2. Open any page (e.g., /dashboard)
3. Check browser console for: [MarketStatus] Initialized
4. Observe progress bar in header

**Expected during market hours:**
- Progress bar green
- Train icon visible
- Bar width matches time elapsed
- Time remaining counts down
- Updates every 30 seconds

### Test 3: Real-Time Updates

1. Open DevTools Network tab
2. Filter by "market-status"
3. Watch for requests every 30 seconds

### Test 4: Mobile Responsive

1. Test on mobile or use DevTools device emulation
2. Verify progress bar scales properly
3. Check mobile time display

### Test 5: Error Handling

1. Stop Flask app
2. Refresh page
3. Check console after 30 seconds

**Expected:**
- Console error logged
- Time display shows "Error"
- Bar becomes gray
- No JavaScript errors
