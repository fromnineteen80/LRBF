# Phase 10: Integration Testing & Polish - Test Results

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Phase:** Role-Based Access Control System  
**Status:** Testing in Progress

---

## 1. Authentication & Session Management

### Login Flow
- [ ] Login with database user (admin role)
- [ ] Login with database user (member role)
- [ ] Login with hardcoded user (admin role)
- [ ] Session stores: user_id, username, role, full_name
- [ ] Session persists across page navigation

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Admin users: `session['role'] = 'admin'`
- ✅ Member users: `session['role'] = 'member'`
- ✅ Hardcoded users: `session['role'] = 'admin'` (backward compatibility)

---

## 2. Navigation Visibility (Role-Based)

### Admin User Navigation
Should see ALL items:
- [ ] Dashboard, Morning, Live, EOD (Trading section)
- [ ] Performance, History, Practice, Calculator (Analytics section)
- [ ] Fund, Ledger, Documents, API Credentials, About, How It Works, Glossary (System section)
- [ ] Profile, Settings (Footer)

### Member User Navigation
Should see MOST items (excluding admin-only):
- [ ] Dashboard, Morning, Live, EOD (Trading section)
- [ ] Performance, History, Practice, Calculator (Analytics section)
- [ ] Fund, Ledger, Documents, About, How It Works, Glossary (System section - NO API Credentials)
- [ ] Profile (Footer - NO Settings)

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Admin sees Settings in footer
- ✅ Admin sees API Credentials in system section
- ✅ Member does NOT see Settings
- ✅ Member does NOT see API Credentials

---

## 3. User Menu (Top Right)

### Admin User Menu
Should display:
- [ ] Full name + "Admin" badge
- [ ] Profile link (with icon)
- [ ] API Credentials link (with icon)
- [ ] Settings link (with icon)
- [ ] Logout link (with icon)

### Member User Menu
Should display:
- [ ] Full name + "Member" badge
- [ ] Profile link (with icon)
- [ ] Logout link (with icon)
- [ ] NO API Credentials
- [ ] NO Settings

### Expected Styling:
- ✅ Role badge has translucent background
- ✅ All menu items have material icons
- ✅ Material Design 3 hover states work

---

## 4. Admin-Only API Endpoints

### Protected Endpoints (should return 403 for non-admin):
- [ ] POST `/api/auth/send-invitation` - Invite new users
- [ ] POST `/api/ledger/record-transaction` - Record capital transaction
- [ ] POST `/api/settings/update` - Update system settings

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Admin users: Endpoints work normally
- ✅ Member users: Return 403 JSON error
- ✅ Error message: "Access denied. Admin privileges required."

---

## 5. Page-Level Role Checks

### Fund Page (`/fund`)
- [ ] All users see fund overview and co-founders list
- [ ] Admin users see "Invite Co-Founder" card
- [ ] Member users do NOT see invitation card
- [ ] "Send Invitation" button functional (admin only)

### Ledger Page (`/ledger`)
- [ ] All users see transaction history
- [ ] All users see account summary
- [ ] Admin users see "Record Transaction" button
- [ ] Member users do NOT see transaction button
- [ ] Transaction modal opens (admin only)
- [ ] API call blocked for members (403)

### Documents Page (`/documents`)
- [ ] All users see quarterly reports section
- [ ] All users see tax documents section
- [ ] All users see fund documents section
- [ ] Admin users see "Audit Trail" section
- [ ] Member users do NOT see audit trail
- [ ] Audit log API call blocked for members (403)

### Settings Page (`/settings`)
- [ ] Admin users can access page
- [ ] Member users redirected to login (route not protected yet - needs fix!)
- [ ] Settings update API blocked for members (403)

### API Credentials Page (`/api-credentials`)
- [ ] Admin users can access page
- [ ] Member users redirected to login (route not protected yet - needs fix!)

---

## 6. Route Protection Analysis

### Currently Protected Routes (with @login_required):
✅ All dashboard pages
✅ Fund, Ledger, Documents pages
✅ Profile, Settings, API Credentials

### Missing Route Protection:
⚠️ Settings page needs `@admin_required` decorator
⚠️ API Credentials page needs `@admin_required` decorator

**Action Required:** Add admin protection to settings and api-credentials routes

---

## 7. Database Integration

### User Data Flow:
- [ ] `db.get_user_by_id()` returns role field
- [ ] Login stores role in session correctly
- [ ] User role persists across requests
- [ ] Role changes in database reflect after next login

### Migration Status:
- ✅ `users` table has `role` column (TEXT, default 'member')
- ✅ Migration script ran successfully
- ✅ Existing users have default role 'member'

---

## 8. UI/UX Polish Checklist

### Material Design 3 Compliance:
- [ ] Role badge styling matches MD3 theme
- [ ] Navigation hover states work correctly
- [ ] User menu animations smooth (200ms ease)
- [ ] Icons properly aligned (20px, vertical-align: middle)
- [ ] All colors use CSS custom properties

### Responsive Design:
- [ ] Navigation works on mobile (collapsible rail)
- [ ] User menu works on mobile

## 9. Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Edge Case Testing:
- [ ] User with no role (NULL) - defaults to 'member'
- [ ] User role changed mid-session - requires re-login
- [ ] Direct URL access to admin pages (member user)
- [ ] API calls to admin endpoints (member user)
- [ ] Hardcoded users work correctly (admin role)

### Error Messages:
- [ ] 403 errors show proper JSON message
- [ ] No exposed stack traces in production
- [ ] User-friendly error messages on frontend

## 10. Known Issues & Fixes Needed

### Issues Found:
1. ⚠️ Settings route missing `@admin_required` decorator
2. ⚠️ API Credentials route missing `@admin_required` decorator
3. ⚠️ Member users can access settings/api-creds via direct URL

### Fixes Required:
- [ ] Add `@admin_required` to `/settings` route
- [ ] Add `@admin_required` to `/api-credentials` route
- [ ] Test member access blocked after fix
