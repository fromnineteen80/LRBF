**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Session:** Continuation from 7adf3faf-364c-4c91-add2-041fc0dc2f90

## üéØ What Was Implemented

Fix #3 completes the user management system by implementing all missing authentication and profile management API endpoints.

### Added Routes (5 new endpoints)

#### 1. Phone Verification Route
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/verify-phone`
- Verifies user phone number with 6-digit SMS code
- Marks user as verified in database
- Sends welcome email after successful verification
- Returns appropriate error messages for invalid codes

**Key Features:**
- Validates code against stored verification code in database
- Checks user exists and is not already verified
- Uses `db.verify_user()` to update database
- Sends welcome email via NotificationService

#### 2. Profile Update Route
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/update-profile`
- Updates user profile information
- Validates all input fields (email format, phone format, etc.)
- Prevents duplicate emails and phone numbers
- Auto-recalculates ownership percentages when fund_contribution changes
- Sends notifications to other co-founders about contribution changes

**Updatable Fields:**
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email` (validated, checked for duplicates)
- `phone_number` (validated, checked for duplicates)
- `timezone`
- `fund_contribution` (triggers ownership recalculation)

**Security Features:**
- Requires authentication (@login_required)
- Validates each field with AuthHelper validators
- Checks for conflicts with other users
- Uses prepared SQL statements to prevent injection

#### 3. Password Change Route
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/change-password`
- Changes user password securely
- Requires current password verification before change
- Validates new password strength
- Optionally invalidates all other sessions (commented out for now)

**Security Features:**
- Verifies current password with bcrypt
- Enforces password strength requirements
- Hashes new password with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Can invalidate all sessions on other devices

#### 4. Account Deletion Page
**Endpoint:** `GET /delete-account`
- Renders account deletion page with payout calculation
- Gets current fund value from IBKR API
- Calculates exact payout amount based on ownership percentage
- Shows pending deletion request if exists
- Provides complete deletion instructions

**Calculated Data:**
- Current fund value (from IBKR or database)
- User's ownership percentage
- Exact payout amount
- Processing timeline (10-15 business days)

#### 5. Account Deletion API Route
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/delete-account`
- Handles account deletion request
- Creates deletion_request in database
- Immediately deactivates user account
- Recalculates ownership percentages for remaining users
- Sends email notifications to all other co-founders
- Logs user out automatically

**Process:**
1. Validates user confirmation
2. Gets current fund value from IBKR
3. Calculates payout amount
4. Creates deletion request record
5. Marks user as inactive
6. Confirms deletion request
7. Sends notifications to other co-founders
8. Clears user session
9. Returns redirect to login page

## üîß Supporting Changes

### 1. NotificationService Enhancements (auth_helper.py)

Added two new notification methods:

#### `send_contribution_change_notification()`
**Purpose:** Notify co-founders when someone changes their fund contribution

**Parameters:**
- `email`: Recipient email
- `recipient_first_name`: Name of recipient
- `changed_user_first_name`: First name of user who changed
- `changed_user_last_name`: Last name of user who changed
- `new_contribution`: New contribution amount
- `new_ownership_pct`: Recipient's updated ownership %

**Email Contents:**
- Details of contribution change
- New contribution amount
- Recipient's updated ownership percentage
- Link to dashboard for more info

#### `send_deletion_notification()`
**Purpose:** Notify co-founders when someone deletes their account

**Parameters:**
- `email`: Recipient email
- `recipient_first_name`: Name of recipient
- `deleted_user_first_name`: First name of deleted user
- `deleted_user_last_name`: Last name of deleted user
- `payout_amount`: Amount being paid out
- `new_ownership_pct`: Recipient's new ownership %

**Email Contents:**
- Account deletion details
- Payout amount
- Processing timeline
- Recipient's new ownership percentage
- Fund impact information

**Development Mode:**
- Both methods print to console instead of sending actual emails
- Ready for production when SendGrid API keys are configured
- Commented production code included for easy activation

### 2. Database Alias (database.py)

Added backwards compatibility alias:
```python
Database = TradingDatabase
```

**Why:** Allows imports like `from modules.database import Database` to work correctly.

## üîí Security Features

### Password Security
- bcrypt hashing with 12 rounds
- Current password required before change
- Password strength validation enforced
- All passwords stored as hashes only

### Session Security
- Requires authentication for all profile operations
- Session tokens validated on every request
- User must be active and verified to perform operations
- Option to invalidate all sessions on password change

### Input Validation
- Email format validation (regex)
- Phone number format validation (US format)
- Username format validation (alphanumeric + underscore)
- Password strength validation (complexity requirements)
- Duplicate checking for emails and phone numbers

### SQL Injection Prevention
- All database queries use parameterized statements
- No string concatenation in SQL queries
- Cursor.execute() with tuple parameters throughout

### Rate Limiting
- Already implemented in app.py for login
- 5 failed attempts = 5-minute lockout
- Applied to all authentication endpoints

---

## üìä Database Methods Used

All routes use existing database methods from `modules/database.py`:

### User Management
- `get_user_by_id(user_id)` - Get user details
- `get_user_by_username(username)` - Find user by username
- `update_user_profile(user_id, updates)` - Update profile fields
- `update_password(user_id, hash)` - Change password
- `verify_user(user_id)` - Mark as verified
- `get_all_users()` - Get all active co-founders
- `get_total_fund_value()` - Sum contributions

### Deletion Tracking
- `create_deletion_request(user_id, fund_value, payout, notes)` - Create request
- `confirm_deletion_request(request_id)` - Execute deletion
- `get_deletion_request(user_id)` - Check pending requests

### Automatic Features
- `_recalculate_ownership()` - Auto-runs when:
  - Fund contribution changes
  - User account deleted
  - New user added
