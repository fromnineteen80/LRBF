# LRBF Project State

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Current Phase:** Phase 0 - Railyard + EOD Backend

## Status
**Status:** Checkpoint - Components 1-4 Complete  
**Next Action:** Decision needed on Component 5 (Filter System). Existing filter_engine.py needs rewrite to add 7 presets. Continue with remaining components now, or rewrite filters first?

## Recent Work
- ✅ Component 1: IBKR Connection Module (Commit 61f3ec4)
- ✅ Component 2: Pattern Detector (3-Step Geometric) (Commit c02996e)
- ✅ Component 3: Pattern Detector (VWAP Breakout) (Commit 5653e8b)
- ✅ Component 4: Entry Signal Detector (Commit 714e505)
- ⚠️ Component 5: Filter System - needs rewrite (7 presets missing)

## Current Phase: Phase 0

**Objective:** Build Railyard (real-time trading engine) + EOD (end-of-day analysis)

**Status:** Building - 4 of 19 components complete

**Implementation Progress:**
- [✅] Component 1: IBKR Connection Module (COMPLETE)
- [✅] Component 2: Pattern Detector (3-Step Geometric) (COMPLETE)
- [✅] Component 3: Pattern Detector (VWAP Breakout) (COMPLETE)
- [✅] Component 4: Entry Signal Detector (COMPLETE)
- [⚠️] Component 5: Filter System (7 presets) (NEEDS REWRITE)
- [ ] Component 6: Position Manager
- [ ] Component 7: Exit Logic Engine
- [ ] Component 8: Risk Management System
- [ ] Component 9: Daily Loss Limit & Kill Switch
- [ ] Component 10: Cooldown Manager
- [ ] Component 11: Metrics Calculator
- [ ] Component 12: Forecast Accuracy Analyzer
- [ ] Component 13: EOD Reporter
- [ ] Component 14: Database Integration Layer
- [ ] Component 15: API Endpoints
- [ ] Component 16: End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Component 17: Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Component 18: Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Component 19: Documentation & User Guide

**Component 5 Status:**
- File: backend/core/filter_engine.py (EXISTS but old architecture)
- Current: Has filter logic but NO presets
- Required: 7 presets for Morning Report forecasts
  - default: Standard thresholds
  - conservative: Tighter filters, lower risk
  - aggressive: Looser filters, higher risk
  - choppy: Optimized for choppy markets
  - trending: Optimized for trending markets
  - abtest: A/B testing variation
  - vwap_breakout: Specific to VWAP breakout strategy
- Morning Report needs these presets to generate 7 forecast scenarios
- Decision: Rewrite now or continue with Components 6-19 first?

**Components 1-4 Summary:**
✅ IBKR Connection - Streaming, reconnection, fill tracking
✅ 3-Step Geometric - Pattern detection from tick data
✅ VWAP Breakout - Pattern detection from tick data
✅ Entry Signal - Monitors +0.5% threshold confirmation

**Next Components (6-19):**
- Position Manager - Submit orders, track positions
- Exit Logic - T1, CROSS, momentum, T2 logic
- Risk Management - Stop loss, position sizing
- Daily Loss Limit - Kill switch at -1.5%
- Cooldown Manager - Prevent overtrading
- Metrics Calculator - Calculate all performance metrics
- Forecast Accuracy - Compare actual vs forecast
- EOD Reporter - Generate end-of-day summary
- Database Integration - Connect all components to DB
- API Endpoints - Expose data to frontend
- Testing, Logging, Monitoring, Documentation

## Technical Context
- **Data Source:** IBKR API via ib_insync
- **Database:** SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Backend:** Flask 3.0+
- **Patterns:** 3-Step Geometric ✅ + VWAP Breakout ✅
- **Entry Signal:** +0.5% threshold ✅
- **Exit Logic:** T1 (0.75%) → CROSS (1.0%) → momentum → T2 (1.75%)

## Token Status
- **Used:** 106k / 190k (55%)
- **Remaining:** 84k
- **Threshold:** 130k used (stop at 60k remaining buffer)
- **Buffer Available:** 24k tokens before threshold

## Notes
- Following incremental approach: build → test → commit → continue
- Commit after each component completion
- Quality gate: component must pass tests before moving to next
- CRITICAL: All detectors/filters shared by Morning Report AND Railyard
