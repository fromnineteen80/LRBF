# LRBF Project State

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Current Phase:** Phase 0 - Railyard + EOD Backend

## Status
**Status:** Building - 6 of 19 components complete
**Next Action:** Build Component 7 (Exit Logic Engine) in backend/core/exit_logic_engine.py. Implement tiered exit system: T1 (+0.75%) → CROSS (+1.00%) → momentum (+1.25%) → T2 (+1.75%), dead zone timeouts, stop loss (-0.5%). Commit: 'Phase 0: Add exit logic engine'

**Component 5 Completion Notes:**
- File: backend/core/filter_engine.py (REWRITTEN)
- Added 7 presets for Morning Report forecast generation:
  1. default - No filters, baseline performance
  2. conservative - All filters ON, tight thresholds (max win rate)
  3. aggressive - Minimal filters, loose thresholds (max frequency)
  4. choppy - S/R focused, optimized for range-bound markets
  5. trending - Momentum focused, optimized for directional markets
  6. abtest - Experimental combinations for testing
  7. vwap_breakout - VWAP breakout strategy specific
- Each preset has specific filter configurations:
  - min_decline_pct, entry_threshold_pct
  - require_volume_confirmation, volume_multiplier
  - check_vwap_proximity, vwap_proximity_pct
  - avoid_first_30min, avoid_last_30min
- Morning Report uses all 7 presets to generate forecast scenarios
- User selects which preset to trade with at 9:00 AM

**Components 1-5 Summary:**
✅ IBKR Connection - Streaming, reconnection, fill tracking
✅ 3-Step Geometric - Pattern detection from tick data
✅ VWAP Breakout - Pattern detection from tick data
✅ Entry Signal - Monitors +0.5% threshold confirmation
✅ Filter System - 7 presets for forecast generation

## Technical Context
- **Data Source:** IBKR API via ib_insync
- **Database:** SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Backend:** Flask 3.0+
- **Patterns:** 3-Step Geometric ✅ + VWAP Breakout ✅
- **Entry Signal:** +0.5% threshold ✅
- **Filters:** 7 presets ✅
- **Exit Logic:** T1 (0.75%) → CROSS (1.0%) → momentum → T2 (1.75%)

## Token Status
- **Used:** 113k / 190k (59%)
- **Remaining:** 77k
- **Threshold:** 130k used (stop at 60k remaining buffer)
- **Buffer Available:** 17k tokens before threshold

## Notes
- Following incremental approach: build → test → commit → continue
- Commit after each component completion
- Quality gate: component must pass tests before moving to next
- Token threshold: Approaching limit, may need to stop soon
- CRITICAL: All components shared by Morning Report AND Railyard
