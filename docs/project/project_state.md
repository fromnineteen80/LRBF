# LRBF Project State

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Current Phase:** Phase 0 - Railyard + EOD Backend

## Status
**Status:** Building - Filter System  
**Next Action:** Check backend/core/filter_engine.py. Verify 7 presets exist (default, conservative, aggressive, choppy, trending, abtest, vwap_breakout). Fix if needed. Commit: 'Phase 0: Verify/fix filter system'

## Recent Work
- Completed Phase 0 exploratory research
- Created requirements.md (institutional-grade standards)
- Created plan.md (19 components, 6 stages, 10 days)
- âœ… Component 1: IBKR Connection Module (Commit 61f3ec4)
- âœ… Component 2: Pattern Detector (3-Step Geometric) (Commit c02996e)
- âœ… Component 3: Pattern Detector (VWAP Breakout) (Commit 5653e8b)
- âœ… Component 4: Entry Signal Detector (Commit 714e505)

## Current Phase: Phase 0

**Objective:** Build Railyard (real-time trading engine) + EOD (end-of-day analysis)

**Status:** Building - implementing components incrementally

**Component 4 Completion Notes:**
- File: backend/core/entry_signal_detector.py (CREATED)
- Monitors tick-by-tick price after pattern completion
- Detects entry signals:
  - 3-Step: +0.5% climb from pattern low
  - VWAP Breakout: +0.5% above VWAP with volume confirmation
- Returns EntrySignal dataclass with:
  - confirmed: bool
  - entry_time: datetime (precise)
  - entry_price: float
  - threshold_price: float
  - failure_reason: str (if not confirmed)
- 180-second timeout window
- Handles both pattern types with unified interface

**Current Component Details (Component 5):**
File: backend/core/filter_engine.py (CHECK IF EXISTS)
Responsibilities:
- 7 filter presets for different market conditions
- Presets: default, conservative, aggressive, choppy, trending, abtest, vwap_breakout
- Each preset has different thresholds and rules
- Used by Morning Report to generate 7 forecast scenarios
- Morning Report recommends which preset to use

Verification:
- Check if file exists
- Verify all 7 presets present
- Ensure preset parameters match trading_strategy_explainer.md
- Fix if needed

## Technical Context
- **Data Source:** IBKR API via ib_insync
- **Database:** SQLite (dev) â†’ PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Backend:** Flask 3.0+
- **Frontend:** Deferred until Phases 0-17 complete
- **Patterns:** 3-Step Geometric âœ… + VWAP Breakout âœ…
- **Entry Signal:** +0.5% from pattern low/VWAP âœ…
- **Exit Logic:** T1 (0.75%) â†’ CROSS (1.0%) â†’ momentum â†’ T2 (1.75%)

## Notes
- Following incremental approach: build â†’ test â†’ commit â†’ continue
- Commit after each component completion
- Ask user "Continue?" after each commit
- Quality gate: component must pass tests before moving to next
- Token threshold: Stop at 130k used (60k remaining buffer)
- CRITICAL: All detectors/filters shared by Morning Report AND Railyard
