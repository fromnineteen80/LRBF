# LRBF Project State

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Current Phase:** Phase 0 - Railyard + EOD Backend

## Status
**Status:** Building - IBKR Connection Module  
**Next Action:** Implement backend/data/ibkr_connector_insync.py with connection management, tick streaming, order submission, and fill reception. Test with paper trading account. Commit: 'Phase 0: Add IBKR connection module'

## Recent Work
- Completed Phase 0 exploratory research
- Created requirements.md (institutional-grade standards)
- Created plan.md (19 components, 6 stages, 10 days)
- Researched institutional trading engine best practices
- Approved requirements and plan
- **NOW BUILDING**: Starting Component 1 of 19

## Current Phase: Phase 0

**Objective:** Build Railyard (real-time trading engine) + EOD (end-of-day analysis)

**Status:** Building - implementing components incrementally

**Implementation Progress:**
- [ðŸ”„] Component 1: IBKR Connection Module (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Component 2: Pattern Detector (3-Step Geometric)
- [ ] Component 3: Pattern Detector (VWAP Breakout)
- [ ] Component 4: Entry Signal Detector
- [ ] Component 5: Filter System (7 presets)
- [ ] Component 6: Position Manager
- [ ] Component 7: Exit Logic Engine
- [ ] Component 8: Risk Management System
- [ ] Component 9: Daily Loss Limit & Kill Switch
- [ ] Component 10: Cooldown Manager
- [ ] Component 11: Metrics Calculator
- [ ] Component 12: Forecast Accuracy Analyzer
- [ ] Component 13: EOD Reporter
- [ ] Component 14: Database Integration Layer
- [ ] Component 15: API Endpoints
- [ ] Component 16: End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Component 17: Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Component 18: Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Component 19: Documentation & User Guide

**Current Component Details:**
File: backend/data/ibkr_connector_insync.py
Responsibilities:
- Connect to IB Gateway (paper: 4002, live: 4001)
- Stream real-time tick data
- Submit market orders
- Receive fill confirmations
- Handle reconnection after disconnection

Testing:
- Connect to paper trading account
- Stream AAPL ticks for 30 seconds
- Submit test order (1 share AAPL)
- Verify fill received
- Test reconnection

## Technical Context
- **Data Source:** IBKR API via ib_insync
- **Database:** SQLite (dev) â†’ PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Backend:** Flask 3.0+
- **Frontend:** Deferred until Phases 0-17 complete
- **Patterns:** 3-Step Geometric + VWAP Breakout
- **Exit Logic:** T1 (0.75%) â†’ CROSS (1.0%) â†’ momentum â†’ T2 (1.75%)

## Notes
- Following incremental approach: build â†’ test â†’ commit â†’ continue
- Commit after each component completion
- Ask user "Continue?" after each commit
- Quality gate: component must pass tests before moving to next
- Token threshold: Stop at 130k used (60k remaining buffer)
