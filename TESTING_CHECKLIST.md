## 📞 SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Email already in use"  
**Solution:** Check database for duplicate. Use different email or delete old account.

**Issue:** "Phone verification code invalid"  
**Solution:** Check console for correct code. Use "Resend Code" if needed.

**Issue:** "Current password is incorrect"  
**Solution:** Use "Forgot Password" feature (when implemented). Contact admin to reset.

**Issue:** "Failed to update profile"  
**Solution:** Check database connection. Verify all fields are valid. Check server logs.

**Issue:** "Account is inactive"  
**Solution:** Account was deleted. Cannot be reactivated. Create new account.

### Debug Mode

To enable verbose logging:
```python
# In app.py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

To test notification emails:
```python
# In auth_helper.py, set:
DEVELOPMENT_MODE = True  # Prints to console instead of sending
```
