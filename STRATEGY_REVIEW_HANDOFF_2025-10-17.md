# LRBF Morning Report - Strategy Review Handoff (October 17, 2025)

## SESSION PURPOSE

Type: Analysis & Validation (NO CODING)
Goal: Stress test calculations, validate assumptions, refine thresholds
Format: You run tests, share findings, I analyze and recommend adjustments

---

## CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS SESSION

We successfully generated the first morning report with:
- 8 primary stocks selected
- Forecast: 73-109 trades, $1200-$1800 daily P&L
- Data stored in database

Critical Questions Emerged:
1. Are the forecast numbers realistic?
2. Is pattern frequency achievable in real markets?
3. Are our thresholds optimal?
4. Do the formulas match the specification?

This session validates the MATH and ASSUMPTIONS behind the strategy.

---

## YOUR ROLE: Run Tests & Document Findings

You will:
1. Run the morning report with different scenarios
2. Test edge cases
3. Document what you observe
4. Share findings

I will:
1. Review your findings
2. Validate formulas
3. Recommend threshold adjustments
4. Explain any anomalies

No coding required from either of us.

## 10 TEST SCENARIOS TO RUN

### Test 1: Pattern Frequency Validation
Verify pattern counts are realistic
- Run morning report in simulation mode
- Record patterns_total for each stock
- Calculate patterns_per_day average
- Question: Are 9-14 patterns/stock/day realistic?

### Test 2: Win Rate Validation
Verify 65% win rate is achievable
- Check win_rate for each selected stock
- Calculate average win rate
- Check wins vs losses breakdown

### Test 3: Expected Value Calculation
Verify expected_value formula is correct

Formula: expected_value = (win_rate x avg_win_pct) - ((1 - win_rate) x avg_loss_pct)

For each stock, manually calculate and compare to reported value.

### Test 4: Quality Score Validation
Understand what makes a high-quality stock

Quality Score = (confirmation_rate x 0.40) + (ev_normalized x 0.30) + (win_rate x 0.20) + (activity_normalized x 0.10)

Compare top 3 stocks vs bottom 3 stocks by quality_score.

### Test 5: Position Sizing Math
Verify position sizing calculations

Given:
- Account balance: $30,000
- Deployment: 80%
- Number of stocks: 8

Expected:
- Deployed capital: $24,000
- Position size per stock: $3,000 (10% of total account)

Check if forecast matches this math.

### Test 6: Daily P&L Forecast Math
Verify daily P&L forecast calculation

Formula per stock:
daily_pl = entries_per_day x position_size x ((win_rate x avg_win_pct) - ((1-win_rate) x avg_loss_pct))

Pick one stock, calculate manually, compare to forecast.

### Test 7: Edge Cases
Test boundary conditions

Scenarios to test:
A. What if a stock has 0 patterns in 20 days?
B. What if a stock has 0% win rate?
C. What if only 5 stocks meet quality criteria?

Document system behavior for each.

### Test 8: Category Distribution
Verify 2/4/2 Conservative/Medium/Aggressive split

Current issue: Simulation gives 8/0/0 (all Conservative)

Category Rules:
- Conservative: conf_rate >= 0.35 AND entries_per_day < 35
- Aggressive: entries_per_day >= 50
- Medium: Everything else

Check if simulation generates diverse data.

### Test 9: Confirmation Rate Reality Check
Validate 25-35% confirmation rate assumption

Our strategy assumes:
- Patterns occur frequently
- Only 25-35% confirm with 1.5% climb threshold

Check actual confirmation_rate for all stocks.
Question: Should entry threshold be 1.0% or 2.0% instead?

### Test 10: Trade Volume Plausibility
Sanity check on 73-109 trades/day

Math:
- 8 stocks
- 73-109 trades total = 9-14 trades per stock per day
- 378 minutes of trading
- Approximately 1 trade every 27-42 minutes per stock

Question: Is this volume achievable in real markets?

---

## THRESHOLD VALIDATION

Current Thresholds (from config.py):

Parameter | Current Value | Question
----------|---------------|----------
ENTRY_THRESHOLD | 1.5% | Test 1.0% or 2.0%?
TARGET_1 | 0.75% | Achievable frequently?
TARGET_2 | 2.0% | Too aggressive?
STOP_LOSS | -0.5% | Too tight or loose?
MIN_CONFIRMATION_RATE | 25% | Should be 30% or 40%?
MIN_EXPECTED_VALUE | 0.0 | Require +0.5%?
MIN_ENTRIES_PER_DAY | 3.0 | Too low? Should be 5?

For each parameter:
1. What values do you see in data?
2. Does threshold make sense?
3. Recommendation: Keep, Increase, or Decrease?

---

## COMPARISON TO SPECIFICATION

From Railyard_Specs.md targets:
- Win rate: 65%
- Average gain: 1.4%
- Average loss: 0.5%
- Daily ROI: 3-5%

Compare morning report output to these targets.

If they don't match:
- Are we close (within 10%)?
- Systematically high or low?
- Should we adjust expectations?

---

## PATTERN ANALYSIS

The 3-Step VWAP Recovery Pattern:
1. Decline: approximately 1% drop from recent high
2. Recovery: 50% of decline (0.5% up)
3. Retracement: 50% of recovery (0.25% down)
4. Confirmation: 1.5% climb from last low

Questions:
- How often would this occur in a liquid stock?
- Is once every 30-40 minutes realistic?
- Are we detecting valid patterns or noise?

---

## RISK MANAGEMENT VALIDATION

Three-Layer Protection System:

Layer 1: Stop Loss (-0.5%)
- Limits individual trade loss
- Question: Appropriate for intraday micro-trades?

Layer 2: Daily Loss Limit (-1.5%)
- Shuts down trading if losing day
- Question: At what point should we stop?

Layer 3: Reserve Ratio (20%)
- Always keep 20% uninvested
- Question: Is 80% deployment safe?

Assessment: Do these layers provide adequate protection?

   - Pattern frequency achievable?
   - Win rate sustainable?
   - P&L projections accurate?

2. Are the formulas correct?
   - Expected value calculation
   - Quality score weighting
   - Position sizing math

3. Are the thresholds optimal?
   - Entry threshold (1.5%)
   - Profit targets (0.75%, 2.0%)
   - Stop loss (-0.5%)

4. What needs adjustment?
   - Which parameters to tune?
   - Which formulas to fix?
   - Which assumptions to revise?

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

Session is successful if we:
1. Validate all calculations are mathematically correct
2. Identify any formula errors or bugs
3. Determine if thresholds are optimal
4. Establish confidence in forecast accuracy
5. Create list of specific improvements

No code is written - just analysis and recommendations.

---

## NEXT STEPS AFTER VALIDATION

Based on findings:
1. Adjust thresholds in config.py
2. Fix any formula errors
3. Refine quality scoring
4. Update forecast calculations
5. Test again with real market data

This session sets foundation for production readiness.

---

## CRITICAL REMINDER

The Strategy Has Three Built-In Protections:
1. Stop loss (-0.5% per trade)
2. Daily loss limit (-1.5% shutdown)
3. Reserve ratio (20% never deployed)

Win rate already includes losses (65% win, 35% loss)

Your job: Validate the MATH, not question the SAFETY.

The question is not "Is this safe?" (it is).
The question is "Are the numbers accurate?" (let's find out).
