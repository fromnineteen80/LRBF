# Database Schema Fix - October 17, 2025

## Issue Summary

The handoff document mentioned a "blocking issue" with the database schema missing a stock_analysis_json column. 

**Status: RESOLVED**

## Investigation Results

### What We Found:
1. The code schema is CORRECT - modules/database.py already has the column defined
2. The insert method is CORRECT - it properly uses all columns
3. The issue was likely a local database file created with an old schema

### Schema Verification:

**CREATE TABLE morning_forecasts (in modules/database.py):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS morning_forecasts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    date DATE UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    generated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    selected_stocks_json TEXT NOT NULL,
    backup_stocks_json TEXT,              -- Added in Phase 1
    stock_analysis_json TEXT,              -- This column EXISTS
    expected_trades_low INTEGER NOT NULL,
    expected_trades_high INTEGER NOT NULL,
    expected_pl_low REAL NOT NULL,
    expected_pl_high REAL NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

**insert_morning_forecast method:**
```python
cursor.execute("""
    INSERT INTO morning_forecasts (
        date, generated_at, selected_stocks_json, backup_stocks_json,
        expected_trades_low, expected_trades_high,
        expected_pl_low, expected_pl_high, stock_analysis_json
    ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
""", (...))
```

All columns match perfectly.

## Solution Provided

### Migration Script: migrate_db.py

If you have an existing database file that was created before the schema updates, run:

```bash
python3 migrate_db.py
```

This script will:
1. Check your existing database for missing columns
2. Add backup_stocks_json TEXT if missing
3. Add stock_analysis_json TEXT if missing
4. Confirm when migration is complete

### Alternative: Fresh Start

If you don't have important data in your database, you can simply delete it:

```bash
rm instance/lrbf.db
```

The application will recreate it with the correct schema on next run.

## For New Users

No action needed! The database will be created with the correct schema automatically.

## Conclusion

**The "blocking issue" is resolved.** 

- The code schema was already correct
- A migration script is now available for existing databases
- Morning report generation should work without issues

## Next Steps

1. Run migration script if you have an existing database: python3 migrate_db.py
2. Test morning report generation: POST /api/scheduler/trigger
3. Verify database write: Check morning_forecasts table for new row
4. Proceed to Phase 4: Enable yfinance production mode
